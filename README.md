# Survey Form
A survey website I created for FreeCodeCamp's Survey Form project. I had to implement project requirements for my site to pass a series of automated tests. 
This site demonstrates my proficiency with HTML forms and CSS styling of form elements. Since the site is hosted in GitHub's Pages static environment, I was unable to include a POST request when the user submits the form.
